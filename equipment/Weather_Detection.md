**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):**Yup:)

**What you are making?** An instrument that detects weather conditions, providing real-time updates on temperature and humidity levels in the vicinity.

**Inspiration:** I typically check the weather and plan my hikes accordingly when I'm exploring Pakistan. This habit inspired me to work on this project.

**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):**
